# TOOLS.md — Local Notes

Skills define how tools work. This file is for your specifics — the stuff that's unique to your setup.

## What Goes Here

Things like:
- API endpoints and keys you use frequently
- SSH hosts and aliases
- Device or service nicknames
- Anything environment-specific

## Why Separate?

Skills are shared. Your setup is yours. Keeping them apart means you can update skills without losing your notes.
