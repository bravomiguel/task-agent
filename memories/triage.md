# Email Triage Rules

Filter incoming emails to find actionable tasks.

## Filter OUT

- Marketing, newsletters, promotions
- Automated notifications (no-reply, system-generated)
- Spam and junk
- FYI-only updates (no action required)
- Simple acknowledgments ("Thanks", "Got it", "Noted")

## Process

- Explicit requests ("Can you...", "Please...")
- Questions requiring a response
- Deadlines or time-sensitive items
- Review/approval requests
- Tasks assigned to you

## The Test

**Does this email require you to DO something?**

- If yes → Process
- If no → Filter out
- If unsure → Filter out (be conservative)
