# Event Triage Rules

Filter incoming events (emails and chat messages) to find actionable tasks.

## Filter OUT

### Emails
- Marketing, newsletters, promotions
- Automated notifications (no-reply, system-generated)
- Spam and junk
- FYI-only updates (no action required)
- Simple acknowledgments ("Thanks", "Got it", "Noted")

### Chat Messages (Slack, Teams)
- Simple acknowledgments ("ok got it", "thanks for this", "will do", "noted")
- Reactions/affirmations without action ("sounds good", "perfect", "great")
- Greetings without requests ("hey", "hi there")
- Status updates with no action needed ("just FYI", "heads up")

### Meetings
- Solo recordings with no action items discussed
- Meetings where you were just listening (no tasks assigned to you)
- Casual catch-ups with no follow-ups or decisions

## Process

- Explicit requests ("Can you...", "Please...")
- Direct questions requiring a response
- Deadlines or time-sensitive items
- Review/approval requests
- Tasks assigned to you
- Requests for help or assistance
- Follow-ups on pending work

## The Test

**Does this event require you to DO something?**

- If yes → Process
- If no → Filter out
- If unsure → Filter out (be conservative)
